                        Management</a></p>
                <p>This project involved designing and implementing a data warehouse solution using SQL Server, with a focus on managing
                    and analyzing spatial data.</p>
                <p>Key features: data normalization, denormalization, ETL processes, performance optimization, and data governance.</p>

                <h2>Work Zone Traffic Crash Analysis in Kentucky</h2>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/TeriD/CodeYou_DataAnalyticsCapstone" target="_blank">CodeYou: Data Analytics Capstone
                        Repository</a></p>
                <p>This repo was my capstone project for the Data Analytics Cohort Spring 2024. The project integrates crash data from
                    the Kentucky State Police
                    Collision Data portal with roadway characteristics from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s API to provide a more
                    accurate and comprehensive
                    view of each incident. The primary objective was to explore new data visualization techniques outside traditional
                    GIS software while uncovering
                    patterns and contributing factors to improve roadway safety in high-risk zones.</p>
                <p>Key features: data acquisition, database design, data normalization, API- integration, python ETL processes, data
                    analytics and data visualization.</p>

                <h2>Emergency Response Milepoint & POI Generation for Kentucky Highways</h2>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/TeriD/Milepoint_POI_Generator" target="_blank">Milepoint POI File Generator</a></p>
                <p>This project automates the generation of precise milepoint locations and critical Points of Interest (POIs) along all
                    interstates and parkways
                    in Kentucky using a spatially enabled transportation dataset. By extracting full-mile and crossover points, the
                    resulting POI layer provides
                    emergency responders with detailed navigational markers that support faster route selection and improved
                    coordination during traffic incidents.
                    The system is designed to enhance emergency response efficiency by helping responders determine the optimal route to
                    crash sites and the
                    quickest path to nearby emergency medical facilities—ultimately minimizing patient transport time and improving
                    outcomes.</p>
                <p>Key features: data interpretation, data generation, python ETL processes, data export</p>

                <h2>GIS Data Link Updater for Legacy Map Documents</h2>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/TeriD/MXD_Repair_Python_Executable" target="_blank">MXD Repair Python Executable</a></p>
                <p>Developed in 2016–2017, this Python-based application was created to automate the update of hard-coded data paths
                    across
                    thousands of legacy GIS map documents in preparation for a statewide software migration at the Kentucky
                    Transportation Cabinet (KYTC).
                    Utilizing Python’s Tkinter module, the project featured a user-friendly GUI that enabled GIS staff to select a
                    folder containing ArcMap
                    documents and automatically reconnect broken data links. The tool scanned each document, updated dataset paths based
                    on the new
                    environment, and saved a corrected copy—eliminating the need for time-consuming manual edits.

                    This solution was critical in supporting a smooth transition to a new GIS software platform, avoiding widespread
                    disruption of map services and saving an estimated hundreds of staff hours. With over 10,000 individual map
                    documents
                    affected, the tool significantly improved efficiency, consistency, and accuracy during a high-impact system upgrade.
