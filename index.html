                    <h3>Pothole Reporter</h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                        This is an interactive, responsive HTML and JavaScript-based form for reporting potholes. It supports location
                        selection
                        via map, dynamic county filtering, reverse geocoding, and user-friendly field validation. The form is tailored
                        for
                        public or internal reporting and is extensible for integration with backend databases and dashboards.

                        Report entries are submitted and stored in a backend database that will feed an interactive dashboard
                        for district personnel. The dashboard will provide a visual representation of the data, including
                        the location of the potholes, the number of reports, and the route metrics. This will allow for
                        better decision making and resource allocation.

                    <h3>Work Zone Traffic Crash Analysis in Kentucky</h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                        As the lead developer, I designed and executed a data-driven project to analyze traffic accidents in
                        construction work zones across Kentucky.
                        The project integrates crash data from the Kentucky State Police Collision Data portal with roadway
                        characteristics from the Kentucky
                        Transportation Cabinet’s API to provide a more accurate and comprehensive view of each incident. The primary
                        objective was to explore
                        new data visualization techniques outside traditional GIS software while uncovering patterns and contributing
                        factors to improve roadway
                        safety in high-risk zones.</p>
