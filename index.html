                <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                    Developed an interactive and responsive web form showcasing my web development skills and incorporating GIS and API
                    calls. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to select their location through either their device's
                    GPS or an interactive map. The form features dynamic county filtering, reverse geocoding from a public-facing API for
                    address identification, and user-friendly field validation to ensure accurate submissions. It is designed for public
                    and internal reporting purposes and can be easily extended to integrate with backend databases and dashboards.</p>

                <h3>Work Zone Traffic Crash Analysis in Kentucky</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong>Description:
                    As the lead developer, I designed and executed a data-driven project to analyze traffic accidents in construction
                    work zones across Kentucky. The project integrates crash data from the Kentucky State Police Collision Data portal
                    with roadway characteristics from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s API to provide a more accurate and
                    comprehensive view of each incident. The primary objective was to explore new data visualization techniques outside
                    traditional GIS software while uncovering patterns and contributing factors to improve roadway safety in high-risk zones.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, Pandas, SQLite, GeoJSON, Plotly, Matplotlib, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook,
